NEW

The game menu tooltip now displays more information, including addon memory usage, and up/download statistics.

The stance bar can now be fully toggled whilst in combat.

Absorb number has been added to the health globe.



FIXED

Paragon Reputation issues have been corrected.

Updated movement bar with correct spell IDs for some classes.

The movement bar should now update with more correct information.

Fixed some translation errors.

The compass should no longer display errors when dead.

The minimap north tag now hides on hover, so as not to obscure the zone text.

Fix for Immersion addon conflict when using the "Hide Minimap" option, where the vanilla minimap zone text UI would display after talking to an NPC.

Addon icons now follow the minimap in a square shape  (Note: using a larger minimap will still cause the icons to overlap the minimap.)

Unitframes will no longer trigger an error when target is using a spell.

Raid frames will no longer display maximum absorb when reloading the UI.

Raid frames now update the name of the unit more frequently.
